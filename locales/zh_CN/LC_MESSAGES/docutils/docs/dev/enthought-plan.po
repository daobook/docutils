"In March 2004 at I met Eric Jones, president and CTO of `Enthought, "
"Inc.`_, at `PyCon 2004`_ in Washington DC.  He told me that Enthought was"
" using reStructuredText_ for source code documentation, but they had some"
" issues.  He asked if I'd be interested in doing some work on a "
"customized API documentation tool.  Shortly after PyCon, Janet Swisher, "
"Enthought's senior technical writer, contacted me to work out details.  "
"Some email, a trip to Austin in May, and plenty of Texas hospitality "
"later, we had a project.  This document will record the details, "
"milestones, and evolution of the project."

"In a nutshell, Enthought is sponsoring the implementation of an open "
"source API documentation tool that meets their needs.  Fortuitously, "
"their needs coincide well with the \"Python Source Reader\" description "
"in `PEP 258`_.  In other words, Enthought is funding some significant "
"improvements to Docutils, improvements that were planned but never "
"implemented due to time and other constraints.  The implementation will "
"take place gradually over several months, on a part-time basis."

"This is an ideal example of cooperation between a corporation and an "
"open-source project.  The corporation, the project, I personally, and the"
" community all benefit.  Enthought, whose commitment to open source is "
"also evidenced by their sponsorship of SciPy_, benefits by obtaining a "
"useful piece of software, much more quickly than would have been possible"
" without their support.  Docutils benefits directly from the "
"implementation of one of its core subsystems.  I benefit from the "
"funding, which allows me to justify the long hours to my wife and family."
