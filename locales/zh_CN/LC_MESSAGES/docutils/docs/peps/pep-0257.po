"The aim of this PEP is to standardize the high-level structure of "
"docstrings: what they should contain, and how to say it (without touching"
" on any markup syntax within docstrings).  The PEP contains conventions, "
"not laws or syntax."

"\"A universal convention supplies all of maintainability, clarity, "
"consistency, and a foundation for good programming habits too. What it "

"A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a "

"All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and "

" file in the package directory."

"String literals occurring elsewhere in Python code may also act as "
"documentation.  They are not recognized by the Python bytecode compiler "
"and are not accessible as runtime object attributes (i.e. not assigned to"

"software tools:"

"Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a one-line "
"docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more elaborate "

"Insert a blank line before and after all docstrings (one-line or multi-"
"line) that document a class -- generally speaking, the class's methods "
"are separated from each other by a single blank line, and the docstring "
"needs to be offset from the first method by a blank line; for symmetry, "
"put a blank line between the class header and the docstring.  Docstrings "
"documenting functions or methods generally don't have this requirement, "

"The docstring of a script (a stand-alone program) should be usable as its"
" \"usage\" message, printed when the script is invoked with incorrect or "
"missing arguments (or perhaps with a \"-h\" option, for \"help\"). Such a"
" docstring should document the script's function and command line syntax,"
" environment variables, and files.  Usage messages can be fairly "
"elaborate (several screens full) and should be sufficient for a new user "

"detail than the summary line in the object's docstring.)  The docstring "
"for a package (i.e., the docstring of the package's ``__init__.py`` "

"arguments are part of the interface."

"The docstring for a class should summarize its behavior and list the "
"public methods and instance variables.  If the class is intended to be "
"subclassed, and has an additional interface for subclasses, this "
"interface should be listed separately (in the docstring).  The class "
"constructor should be documented in the docstring for its ``__init__`` "
"method.  Individual methods should be documented by their own docstring."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docutils/docs/peps/pep-0257.txt:184
msgid ""
"If a class subclasses another class and its behavior is mostly inherited "
"from that class, its docstring should mention this and summarize the "
"differences.  Use the verb \"override\" to indicate that a subclass "
"method replaces a superclass method and does not call the superclass "
"method; use the verb \"extend\" to indicate that a subclass method calls "
"the superclass method (in addition to its own behavior)."

"*Do not* use the Emacs convention of mentioning the arguments of "
"functions or methods in upper case in running text.  Python is case "

"list each argument on a separate line.  For example::"

"The BDFL [3]_ recommends inserting a blank line between the last "
