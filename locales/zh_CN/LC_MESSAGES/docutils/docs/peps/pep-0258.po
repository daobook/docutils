"In Python docstrings, interpreted text is used to classify and mark up "

"Stylist transforms are specialized transforms specific to the PySource "
"Reader.  The PySource Reader doesn't have to make any decisions as to "
"style; it just produces a logically constructed document tree, parsed and"
" linked, including custom node types.  Stylist transforms understand the "
"custom nodes created by the Reader and convert them into standard "
"Docutils nodes."

"Multiple Stylist transforms may be implemented and one can be chosen at "
"runtime (through a \"--style\" or \"--stylist\" command-line option). "
"Each Stylist transform implements a different layout or style; thus the "
"name.  They decouple the context-understanding part of the Reader from "
"the layout-generating part of processing, resulting in a more flexible "
"and robust system.  This also serves to \"separate style from content\", "
"the SGML/XML ideal."

"By keeping the piece of code that does the styling small and modular, it "
"becomes much easier for people to roll their own styles.  The \"barrier "
"to entry\" is too high with existing tools; extracting the stylist code "
"will lower the barrier considerably."
