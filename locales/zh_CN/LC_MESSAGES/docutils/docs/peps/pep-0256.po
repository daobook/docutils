"Python lends itself to inline documentation.  With its built-in docstring"
" syntax, a limited form of `Literate Programming`_ is easy to do in "
"Python.  However, there are no satisfactory standard tools for extracting"

"The issues surrounding docstring processing have been contentious and "

"These systems, each with different goals, have had varying degrees of "

"components: a docstring extraction system, a markup parser, an internal "
