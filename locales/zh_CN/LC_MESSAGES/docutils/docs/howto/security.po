"Initially, Docutils was intended for command-line tools and single-user "
"applications.  Through-the-web editing and processing was not envisaged, "
"therefore web security was not a consideration.  Once "
"Docutils/reStructuredText started being incorporated into an ever-"
"increasing number of web applications (blogs__, wikis__, content "
"management systems, and others), several security issues arose and have "
"been addressed.  Still, **Docutils does not come in a through-the-web "
"secure state**, because this would inconvenience ordinary users.  This "
"document provides pointers to help you secure the Docutils software in "
"your applications."
